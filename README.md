👋 Hey there — I’m TaeJoo Kim, the mind behind **Lucy Nailed It**, a full-stack salon-booking platform integrating React, Node.js, and Square API.  

💻 I love turning UX-focused product ideas into production-ready apps — blending creativity with solid engineering.  
🎖️ My background? Team Leader (13J) in the Army National Guard — where I led teams, trained personnel, and delivered mission-critical data under pressure.  
That experience shaped how I build software: disciplined, scalable, and user-driven.

**Tech Stack:**  
React · Node.js / Express · MongoDB · Square API · Google Cloud · TailwindCSS · Git  

**Current Focus:**  
- Expanding Lucy Nailed It with real-time booking & mobile optimization  
- Building clean, maintainable APIs & micro-services  
- Continuous learning in DevOps & system design
